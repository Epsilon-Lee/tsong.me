# Rectilinear Steiner Tree

by Jiaming Song

In this project, three methods (SMST, LMST, ZMST), which are proposed in this paper
<a href="http://actel.kr/_hdl/4/_book/users.ece.gatech.edu/limsk/book/papers/l-shape.pdf" target="_blank">
    New Algorithms for the Rectilinear Steiner Tree Problem</a>, are implemented.

The implementation was selected for the 2012-2013 Summer Programming Course as a base algorithm for a
Qt5 GUI project.
