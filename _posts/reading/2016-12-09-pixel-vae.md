## PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model for Natural Images

The proposed model, makes use of PixelCNN to model an autoregressive decoder for a VAE.

VAEs suffer from blurry samples, partly because it assume independence among pixels (another reason is the latent code learns to generate the mean of the mappings during training.), while PixelCNN lacks the latent representations that might be more useful for other tasks.

As oppsed to VAE, the decoder is a conditional PixelCNN on the decoder. The decoder models $$x$$ as the product of each dimension $$x_i$$ conditioned on all previous dimensions and the latent variable $$z$$:


$$
p(x \lvert z) = \prod_{i} p(x_i \lvert x_1, \ldots, x_{i-1}, z)
$$


The hierarchical structure employed here is as follows:


$$
L = \log p(x\lvert z_1) + D_{KL}(q(z_1 \lvert x) \lVert p(z_1 \lvert z_2)) + \sum_{l=2}^{L} D_{KL} (q(z_l \lvert z_{l-1}) \lVert p(z_l))
$$
There is an illustration of the framework here:
