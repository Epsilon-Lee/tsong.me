## Neural Episodic Control

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01988](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01988)

Use an auxillary memory called Differentiable Neural Dictionary (DND) to store $$Q(s, a)$$, which is indexed by $$s$$ and $$a$$.

- $$a$$ is indexed by creating a DND for each possible value. (This might be problematic when the action space is huge)
- $$s$$ is indexed by using a embedding $$h$$ of the current frame.



The memory is assumed to be infinite. If the same $$h$$ is observed, then write updates the memory; otherwise, the $$Q(s, a)$$ value is stored as a key-value pair.

The memory is retreived by non-parametric kernel methods. Once a $$Q(s, a)$$ is retreived, $$N$$-step deep Q-learning is performed.
