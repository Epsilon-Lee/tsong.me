## Distant Supervision for Relation Extraction via Piecewise Convolutional Neural Networks

Two problems of distant supervision for relation extraction

1. The distant supervision is too strong and causes wrong labeling
2. The features in definition may propagate in downstream tasks

Here, the authors proposed a model called Piecewise Convolutional Neural Networks (PCNN), which basically use max-pooling in three sequences separated by two entities of the sentences instead of one entire sentence. Therefore, it reduces the over-reduction of information.
