## High-Dimensional Continous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation

Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438)



If the true value function under policy $$\pi$$ and discount factor $$\gamma$$ is $$V^{\pi, \gamma}(s_t)$$, then 

$$
\delta_t^V = r_t + \gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)
$$


is a unbiased estimator of the $$\gamma$$-discounted advantage function.

Consider taking the sum of $$k$$ of these $$\delta$$ terms, which will be denoted as $$\hat{A}_t^{(k)}$$. We have


$$
\hat{A}_{t}^{\infty} = -V(s_t) + \sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\gamma^l r_{t+l}
$$


The generalized advantage estimator $$GAE(\gamma, \lambda)$$ is the exponentially-weighted average of these $$k$$-step estimators. There is a bias-variance trade-off between the value of $$\lambda$$. 

- If $$\lambda$$ is close to 0, then the estimator has low variance but high bias.
- If $$\lambda$$ is close to 1, then the estimator has high variance but low bias.
