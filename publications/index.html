                            Network science is critical to understanding management
                            due to its extensive applications in complex systems with
                            network-based structures. Since the organization of ICM
                            forms an network structure, network science can be utilized
                            to analyze dynamic processes within the team, e.g.
                            the diffusion effects of organizational churn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this paper, we construct a Human Capital network according
                            to the hierarchical structure of ICM and create a simple yet
                            effective model to capture the dynamic processes, which includes
                            organizational churn, promotion, and recruitment.
                            For organizational churn, we propose and implement our
                            probabilistic churn model inspired by Bayesian learning principles,
                            which estimates and updates the likelihood of individual churn
                            using the Beta-Bernoulli distribution.
                            Then we develop three promotion measures based on working
                            experience, inclination to churn, and closeness centrality.
                            Moreover, we propose several means of controlling the
                            recruitment rate from the HR's perspective, and further
                            define some key concepts for evaluation, such as dissatisfaction and productivity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through extensive simulations, we show that our model is
                            flexible enough to encompass most features of the current
                            situation and yield convincing productivity and cost results.
                            We further extend our model to scenarios with higher churn
                            rates, and discover an interesting fact that higher churn
                            rates lead to lower productivity-cost ratios. In an extreme
                            case with no recruitment, we discover differentiated HR
                            health degeneration among different offices over two years
                            through visualization.

                            Link prediction is a fundamental task in statistical network analysis.
                            Recent advances have been made on learning flexible nonparametric Bayesian
                            latent feature models for link prediction. In this paper, we present a
                            max-margin learning method for such nonparametric latent feature relational
                            models. Our approach attempts to unite the ideas of max-margin learning
                            and Bayesian nonparametrics to discover discriminative latent features
                            for link prediction. It inherits the advances of nonparametric Bayesian
                            methods to infer the unknown latent social dimension, while for
                            discriminative link prediction, it adopts the max-margin learning principle
                            by minimizing a hinge-loss using the linear expectation operator,
                            without dealing with a highly nonlinear link likelihood function.
                            For posterior inference, we develop an efficient stochastic variational
                            inference algorithm under a truncated mean-field assumption.
                            Our methods can scale up to large-scale real networks with
                            millions of entities and tens of millions of positive links.
                            We also provide a full Bayesian formulation, which can avoid tuning
                            regularization hyper-parameters. Experimental results on a diverse
                            range of real datasets demonstrate the benefits inherited from
                            max-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametric inference.
